# Airline-Fare-ML-predictions

Contributer: Danial Khan

--> Project is based on the Udemy course, Data Science Real World Projects in Python by Shan Singh with the following link:

https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-real-world-projects-in-python-x/

I have a keen interest in Machine Learning techniques, Artificial Intelligence. Therefore to explore further I took the course mentioned previously. I showcase my understanding of git, python, jupyter, and various python frameworks such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, etc.

In this specific project, based on given raw data, my goal is to predict airline fares using machine learning models.

●	A given raw table with airline information includes sources, dates, prices, and the number of stops for a given flight.
●	Learning and implementing linear regression, random forest, KNN machine learning algorithms.
●	Focusing on statistical analysis, including decision trees, cross-validation, and label-encoding.

The following ideas are also explored to learn more about the the process involved in real-world data science projects:
1. Defining the problem
2. Data Collection
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Extracting Data, Converting Data to numbers
5. Feature Engineering steps
6. Applying Machine Learning Algorithms
